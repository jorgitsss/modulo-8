  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "blogger"=>{"titulo"=>"Estrategia Nacional de Turismo (ENT) 2030", "contenido"=>"\"Estrategia Nacional de Turismo 2030. Nos encontramos terminando el primer trimestre del 2022, periodo que, desde el punto de vista de la industria del turismo, ha estado marcada por grandes desafíos, entre ellos, la adaptación de los destinos a la realidad impuesta por la aún presente pandemia, el descubrimiento y apertura al turista nacional de destinos tradicionalmente enfocados en el turista extranjero, la acelerada necesidad de digitalización de la industria que se ha impuesto en el último tiempo -y que llegó para quedarse!-, y el desafío para el sector que representa el cambio climático, entre otros.Navegando por una conocida red social, me encontré con un interesante documento donde se presenta la Estrategia Nacional de Turismo (ENT) 2030, la cual ha sido diseñada por la Subsecretaría de Turismo, en conjunto con otros actores de la industria nacional. Este documento define la hoja de ruta para el desarrollo del sector hacia el 2030 y está estructurado en torno a cuatro pilares estratégicos: 1) Sustentabilidad -económica, social y ambiental-, 2) Innovación y transformación digital, 3) Desarrollo regional, 4) y la Experiencia del turista.  Después de leer el documento hay mucho para reflexionar. Es una herramienta interesante para ver cómo se perfilará el desarrollo del sector en los próximos años y cómo los emprendimientos, las organizaciones y los destinos turísticos estarán insertos en los diferentes planes de acción. También cómo se articulará la gobernanza del proyecto. Será interesante además descubrir, a medida que se publiquen, el detalle de cada una de las iniciativas y cómo ellas contribuirán al desarrollo del turismo en Chile, especialmente para la puesta en valor de una oferta de calidad y con contenido, para así transformar a Chile en el destino “imperdible” que tanto deseamos.\"", "link"=>"https://www.andando.cl/2022/03/24/estrategia-nacional-de-turismo-2030/", "tipo"=>"2", "estado"=>"1"}, "commit"=>"Create Blogger"}

Nos encontramos terminando el primer trimestre del 2022, periodo que, desde el punto de vista de la industria del turismo, ha estado marcada por grandes desafíos, entre ellos, la adaptación de los destinos a la realidad impuesta por la aún presente pandemia, el descubrimiento y apertura al turista nacional de destinos tradicionalmente enfocados en el turista extranjero, la acelerada necesidad de digitalización de la industria que se ha impuesto en el último tiempo -y que llegó para quedarse!-, y el desafío para el sector que representa el cambio climático, entre otros.Navegando por una conocida red social, me encontré con un interesante documento donde se presenta la Estrategia Nacional de Turismo (ENT) 2030, la cual ha sido diseñada por la Subsecretaría de Turismo, en conjunto con otros actores de la industria nacional. Este documento define la hoja de ruta para el desarrollo del sector hacia el 2030 y está estructurado en torno a cuatro pilares estratégicos: 1) Sustentabilidad -económica, social y ambiental-, 2) Innovación y transformación digital, 3) Desarrollo regional, 4) y la Experiencia del turista.  Después de leer el documento hay mucho para reflexionar. Es una herramienta interesante para ver cómo se perfilará el desarrollo del sector en los próximos años y cómo los emprendimientos, las organizaciones y los destinos turísticos estarán insertos en los diferentes planes de acción. También cómo se articulará la gobernanza del proyecto. Será interesante además descubrir, a medida que se publiquen, el detalle de cada una de las iniciativas y cómo ellas contribuirán al desarrollo del turismo en Chile, especialmente para la puesta en valor de una oferta de calidad y con contenido, para así transformar a Chile en el destino “imperdible” que tanto deseamos.\""], ["link", "https://www.andando.cl/2022/03/24/estrategia-nacional-de-turismo-2030/"], ["tipo", 2], ["estado", 1], ["created_at", "2022-12-23 04:11:27.524696"], ["updated_at", "2022-12-23 04:11:27.524696"]]
